# React Popup Test Case
A simple test case demonstrating an interesting bug with binding popup event listeners in React.

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Node v10 (I recommend leveraging [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- [Optional] [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Install dependencies with `npm i` or `yarn`, then run with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
